## What this notebook covers
This notebook explores the fundamental and applied aspects of wetting phenomena to enhance the performance and stability of porous media in membrane and electrochemical systems. You will see how we use advanced, non-invasive visualization tools like MRI and FLIM to quantify spatio-temporal wetting patterns and identify active reaction zones at the triple-phase boundary in real-time. Our research introduces high-precision methodologies such as impedance porometry, which measures ion currents to determine pore size distributions with significantly greater accuracy than traditional flow-based methods. We also investigate the complex dynamics of state transitions, such as the row-by-row "zipping" mechanism during the Cassie-Baxter to Wenzel transition and the impact of potential-driven electrowetting on gas diffusion electrodes. Finally, you can expect to find how we engineer surfaces through polyelectrolyte pore bridging or by tailoring zeta potential to stabilize fluid-fluid displacement and control viscous fingering.

## Main insights
- Wetting is a omnipresent phenomenon affecting membrane and porous electrode properties
- Understanding its spatio-temporal properties is the next frontier in electrochemical membrane reactors
