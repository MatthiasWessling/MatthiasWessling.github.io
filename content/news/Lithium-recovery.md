Lithium recovery is becoming a central challenge in building a truly circular battery economy. While much attention is placed on cobalt and nickel, lithium is often diluted, lost, or recovered late in the recycling flowsheet.

In the recent work of the team around Kerstin Wienkamp published in

we explore a different route. Starting from a real wet-shredding process of spent NMC811 batteries, we obtain an aqueous stream dominated by lithium fluoride (LiF) – a poorly soluble and impurity-laden mixture. Instead of relying on precipitation chemistry, we integrate salt metathesis directly into a continuous flow-electrode capacitive deionization (FCDI) process.

The concept is simple in principle, but powerful in practice: we convert LiF into highly soluble lithium hydroxide (LiOH) while simultaneously concentrating it. Using synthetic feeds, we achieve 70-fold concentration to ~35 g/L impurity-free LiOH with lithium recovery up to 92% when partial recirculation is applied. Importantly, the system operates continuously and below faradaic thresholds, avoiding electrode side reactions.

We then challenged the system with the actual wet-shredding effluent. As expected, ionic and organic impurities reduce performance. Yet even under these realistic conditions, we produce ~19 g/L LiOH at 90 mol% purity and demonstrate stable operation. Upscaling the membrane area from 100 cm² to 320 cm² confirms scalability with only modest performance decline.

For us, this study continues a broader line of work on flow-electrode systems and electrochemical separations. It also connects membrane science with battery recycling in a way that rethinks where lithium should be captured in the process chain — ideally early, before dilution and losses accumulate.

From a scientific perspective, the work shows that electrochemical salt metathesis can overcome solubility limits in continuous operation. From an industrial perspective, it offers a mild-conditioned and potentially energy-efficient route to produce market-relevant LiOH directly from recycling streams.

Curious to hear how others approach early-stage lithium recovery — especially in complex, impurity-rich streams.
